The primary objective of this project is to develop and implement data-driven techniques and predictive models to identify and prevent fraudulent activities within the healthcare provider systems. There have been many fraudulent activities happening within the industry such as billing & insurance fraud, unnecessary medical procedure etc. These fraudulent activities divert resources away from providing quality healthcare to patients. Identifying these frauds and predicting future frauds would help the healthcare industry not only provide quality healthcare to patients but also reduce financial losses, reputation loss, improve compliance and resource allocation as well as gain patient trust.

This poster outlines data collection and analysis techniques, illustrates rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing. We employ four machine learning models for health insurance fraud prediction, meticulously training and evaluating them on a test dataset using diverse metrics. The abstract concludes by identifying the top-performing model and offering insights into its superior performance.
